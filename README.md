# Logo and icons for the Nostr protocol

Yes, the nostr protocol is entirely decentralized, and there are no obligations on using a particular logo.
Everyone is free to contribute to the nostr ecosystem and create the visuals they like.
However, we believe that having a recognizable logo would be beneficial for the Nostr community as a whole!

Here you can find a proposal by [Andrea Nicolini, aka Bembureda](https://dribbble.com/Bembureda).
Andrea prepared multiple versions of the logo and icons you see below.
I hope you like it!
