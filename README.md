# Logo and icon for the Nostr community

Yes, the nostr protocol is entirely decentralized, and there are no obligations to use a particular logo.
Everyone is free to contribute to the nostr ecosystem and create the visuals they like.
However, we believe that having a recognizable logo would be beneficial for the Nostr community as a whole!

Below you can find a proposal by [Andrea Nicolini, aka Bembureda](https://dribbble.com/Bembureda).  

==> [Download the full package here](/nostr-logo-and-icon.zip), it includes PNG and SVG versions, in different sizes and colors.
